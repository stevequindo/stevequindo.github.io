<h1>Authenticity</h1>

<p>What is Authenticity and why is it important? Intuitively, we all know that living authentically is better than not.
    But I think not everyone has the same idea of what it means to be
    Authentic.</p>

<p>When we describe a person as authentic, we can probably also use the word <em>genuine</em>. And for most cases, a
    person is genuine because they never seem like they're hiding anything or have
    hidden motives. It's important to note that even an evil person can be authentic too.</p>

<p>They do more things that they love, and less of what they don't. They lie less to others and to themselves. They say
    things from the heart regardless of what others think. And their behaviour is
    very little influenced by external factors.</p>

<p>How do we become someone with all these traits? I think it's all rooted in being extremely self aware and having a
    stable self-esteem. Knowing who you are is a natural prerequisite to living
    authentically.</p>

<p>Most of us don't have original thoughts for 99% of topics. This requires a lot of work. Our views are usually
    something we've read and heard, this is especially true for younger people.</p>

<p>So whenever you do or say something, think for a second if it's really coming from you or if it's someone else's
    thoughts. It's okay to preface your sentences with "I read somewhere that…" (or
    similar) and that you don't really have a strong opinion on the subject (yet). It's better than acting like someone
    you're not.</p>

<p>For actions, you'd know if what you're doing is not genuine because you'd feel it in your gut and often wish you
    acted differently.</p>

<p>Social factors are a huge reason for people suppressing themselves, such as wanting to "fit in" or being "politically
    correct". I'll tell you why I think this is bad idea.</p>

<p>Firstly, it's tiring to act against your nature. This is partly the reason it's more tiring to be around people that
    you can't be yourself with. You end up putting more thought into your actions
    and what you say, which drains your energy really fast. Avoid this.</p>

<p>Secondly, being yourself leads to a richer and fuller life. When you meet people who like you and want to be friends
    with you, you'll know it's real. This is especially important when finding a
    partner.  <a href="#ref1">[1]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, you'll be a more interesting person. People hide behind the opinions of others, and most people don't even
    realise they're doing this. It's a defence mechanism that our ego uses to
    protect themselves from external judgement. It's easier to dismiss criticism if what you said or did wasn't really
    you. <a href="#ref2">[2]</a> </p>

<p>Practice being authentic until it becomes second nature. The alternative to that is being inauthentic, and no one
    wants to be that, even if they can't explain why.</p>

<div class="notes">
    <p id="ref1">[1] List down the traits of the people you respect the most, then start acting out those traits. It’s
        probably a good idea to be someone you would respect when “being yourself”.</p>

    <p id="ref2">[2] This behaviour is more common than you think, don't be that person. Having
        your own opinions, even wrong (given that you admit you're wrong later), makes you a more interesting person.</p>
