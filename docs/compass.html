<h1>Internal Compass</h1>

<p>There's this general idea that you have choose between living in the moment and sacrificing for the future. That at any point in time you have to choose between the two. This is a common dilemma, especially with people in their 20s.</p>

<p>Well I think these two can be done together and that it's important that you structure your life in a way that enables this. It allows you to be fully present but also not neglect the future.</p>

<p>How can you do these things at the same time?</p>

<p>One obvious answer is to be fully engaged in something <em>now</em> that also contributes to your future. You need to define a general direction for your life to do this. This is different to setting goals, and I think is more important. <a href="#ref1">[1]</a></p>

<p>Direction means having a general idea on what you want to do or who you want to be. An example is wanting to be physically strong, disciplined or smart.</p>

<p>But what should you be disciplined in? Which sport should you do? What books should you read? It doesn't matter! Just avoid things that completely derails you to becoming any of those attributes. <a href="#ref2">[2]</a> It starts becoming your literal internal compass for decision making.</p>

<p>So when you're stuck between choices, ask yourself which leads you away or towards where your internal compass is pointing. And the choices that aligns with your compass tend to be things you can fully be engaged in while simultaneously not worrying about the future. <a href="#ref3">[3]</a></p>

<p>This doesn't mean saying no to everything that isn't where your compass is pointing. As long as the decision you make isn't permanently damaging (or makes it really really hard to go back on track), then simply enjoy the side quests in life, life's more interesting that way.</p>

<p>Balancing these things is hard, but always striving for balance is probably not a good thing. There are seasons in your life and you have to recognise which one you're in and take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Having direction allows you to worry less of the future since what you're doing now, at the very very least, takes you further away from where you <em>don't</em> want to be. <a href="#ref4">[4]</a> And if that's the only thing you do in life, I reckon you'll have a pretty good life.</p>

    <p id="ref1">[1] If you struggle with having direction, ask yourself who you <strong>don't</strong> want to be, or what you definitely <strong>don't</strong> want to do in life, then just avoid everything that leads to that way. This counts as direction, we just went about it the opposite way.</p>

    <p id="ref2">[2] Like adopting a bad habit, for example consistently staying up late and having poor quality sleep because of it.</p>

    <p id="ref3">[3] Because at the very least you're not heading towards where you <strong>don't</strong> want to go. A common theme here is: flip the question instead, it's usually easier to answer. An example being <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</p>

    <p id="ref4">[4] I personally get a lot of comfort from this fact alone and knowing this makes me worry about my own future a lot less. It makes me feel "mentally free", whatever that means.</p>
